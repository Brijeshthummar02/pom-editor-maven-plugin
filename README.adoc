== Introduction

Facilitate manipulation such as managing POM dependencies through CLI (command line interface)

== How to use it

Let's suppose that you need to add JUnit Jupiter version 5.9.2 into your POM in the test scope, you could perform the following command inside on the target maven project:

[source, sh]
----
mvn br.org.soujava:pom-editor:add-dep -Dgav='org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.9.2' -Dscope=test
----

It's a Maven plugin then you may register the groupId into your `settings.xml` pluginGroups node :

[source,xml]
----
<settings >
    <!-- snipped -->
    <pluginGroups>
      <pluginGroup>br.org.soujava</pluginGroup>
    </pluginGroups>
    <!-- snipped -->
</settings>
----

Then you'll be able to perform the plugin by its prefix:

[source,sh]
----
mvn pom-editor:add-dep -Dgav='org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.9.2' -Dscope=test
----

== Goals

It covers the following goals:

* Add/Change dependencies at POM.xml
